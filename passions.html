            <h1>Professional Commitment to Insurance and Finance</h1>

            <p>Hello, I'm Ny-Jianah Zeigler, and I'm passionate about forging a successful career as an insurance agent and financial advisor. My journey in these fields has been marked by dedication, resilience, and a constant pursuit of excellence.</p>

            <p>I commenced my career as a life insurance agent with American Income Life of Globe Life. While the beginning was interrupted by the challenges of commissions-based income during the early stages of the pandemic, I honed essential skills that form the foundation of my professional identity.</p>

            <p>During my seven months as an insurance agent, I developed expertise in drive, motivation, negotiation, communication, sales, presentation, public speaking, client relationship management, contract binding, rapport building, scheduling, and various aspects of client policy management.</p>

            <p>My commitment to continuous improvement led me to a role as a tutor, where I organized and networked to earn $600 a week for 24 hours of schooling. Subsequently, I transitioned into the fast-paced environment of the food industry, climbing the ranks from a crew member to assistant manager within six months.</p>

            <p>As the world emerged from the pandemic, I sought a role as a water consultant at AquaLiteUS. There, I not only contributed to a substantial increase in company revenue but also managed a team of home depot canvassers, demonstrating my leadership and strategic thinking skills.</p>

            <p>Driven by the desire to further excel, I am pursuing licensing and education in finance and insurance, aiming for certifications such as SIE, Series 7, and Series 63. These endeavors reflect my commitment to continuous learning and skill development.</p>

            <p>I am now seeking a company that recognizes and nurtures potential, offering a platform for me to contribute significantly to the success of the business while achieving my professional goals. Let's embark on this journey together!</p>
